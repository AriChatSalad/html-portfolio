 <h1>The best movies according to Aritra</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
 <p>Its hands down the best work of legendary director, Chrisptoher Nolan.</p>
 <h3>The Notebook</h3>
 <p>It is one of the best acting performances of Rayn Gosling and 
    one of the best rom-coms I have ever seen.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Its easily the most thrilling, confusing and mind goggling
    movie I have ever seen featuring Leo Dicap.</p>
